            <h3>1.What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h3>
            <p>The first thing I noticed is the jittery button of "Explore Me". Because it keeps shakng and make a strong contrast with its red colour and green background. Its shadow also highlights itself.
               </p>
          </div>

           <div class="prompts2">
            <h3>2.Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Click "Explore Me" button</li>
                <li>Click "Portfolio" button</li>
                <li>Hovering on Ritwick Dey's avatar</li>
                <li>Click "Angular" "React.js" "Node.js" "ASRNET" button</li>
                <li>Click returning button on the left top page.</li>
              </ol>
            </div>

            <br>

          <div class="prompts1">
            <h3>3.What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h3>
            <p>Click the category button to filter all the projects Ritwick Dey created.</p>
          </div>

            <br>
          
          <div class="prompts1">
            <h3>4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h3>
            <p>Reading content and clicking buttons.</p>
          </div>

            <br>

          <div class="prompts2">
            <h3>5.What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h3>
            <p>My impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience is that interface and elements should be designed with apparent directivity, 
              in order to let vistors know on which area of this website by what operating they can get the information they want.  </p>
          </div>

            <br>

          <div class="prompts3">
            <h3>6.What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?</h3>
            <p>Interactive expereince communicates its primary goal with several design elements including shape, color, material of website components. 
            For example, initial interface of Ritwick Dey's Portfolio presents a teal and blue folder-like page, and he design "Explore Me" button as a red seal of 
            this folder to let visitors know that they can click this button to get more information of him.</p>
          </div>

            <br>

            <div class="prompts1">
            <h3>7.What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h3>
            <p>5 times per minute.</p>
          </div>

            <br>

          <div class="prompts1">
            <h3>8.What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?</h3>
            <p>Interface should show both forward and backward transformation as user/visitor operating. For instance, when user click “Portfolio” button, background 
              image shift to left to imply that visitor has been jumped into next interface.</p>
           </div>

            <br>
            <div class="prompts1">
            <h3>9.What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h3>
            <p>Professional avatar, listing his skills on a underline menu.</p>
          </div>

            <br>
            <div class="prompts1">
            <h3>10.What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should act when engaging with it?</h3>
            <p>The underline menu encourages me to read the content in category.</p>
          </div>

          <br>

          <div class="prompts1">
            <h3>11.What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should feel when engaging with it?</h3>
            <p>The information is organized well and easy to read.</p>
          </div>

          <br>

          <div class="prompts1">
            <h3>12.What is the most frustrating element of the interaction to you and what makes it frustrating?</h3>
            <p>Category button and its refresh mechanism. I had to click all the other language buttons until the only one I wanted left, which is all about repeating and 
              exhaust my patience.  </p>
            </div>

              <br>

              <div class="prompts1">
            <h3>13.What is the most satisfying element of the interaction to you and what makes it satisfying?</h3>
            <p>To me, the most satisfying element of the interaction is returning button on the left top branch page. Because it has a delicate shape and indicates its function clearly.</p>
